# Retinal_Eye_Fundus
A medical purpose project which helps in classifying the Retinal Eye Funuds Disease.

This is a Deep Learning based Analysis for Diagnosis of Retinal Eye Fundus Disease by using image processing and identify those images for classification based on four categories that are:
1. Cataract 2.Diabetic Retinopathy 3.Glaucoma 4.Normal

The convolutional neural network model used here Inception-ResNetV2 and the comparison between the optimizers like sgdm, adam and rmsprop is been done. 

The Dataset is been taken from Kaggle

This Dataset consists of Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract and Glaucoma retinal images where each class have approximately 1000 images.
